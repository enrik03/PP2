One box with xyz periodic boundaries. 

I use the Leanard Jones potential. (lj126) (R_cut = 2.5)

3 regions are created in the box, 2 types of atomic particles.

Lattice 1 https://docs.lammps.org/lattice.html

The energy, volumen and density are constants.
The temperature as well.

I use a verlet list. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_list

The thermo style prints: ke pe etotal press vol density.

With the dump function, I use vmd 1.9.3 to visualize the simulation.

R_cut = 2.5

Sigma  = 1.0 

Epsilons:
A - A:   = 1.0 
A - B:   = 1.41 
B - B:   = 2.0 

mass = 1.0
